# Problem Statement - Odoo X sns Hackathon 2026
Travel planning is often fragmented, stressful, and disconnected. Travelers struggle to organize itineraries, manage budgets across different currencies, and find authentic community recommendations in one place. Existing solutions lack an integrated, intelligent ecosystem that combines planning, budgeting, and social sharing.
